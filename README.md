# Sales-Dashboard
A sales rep performance dashboard lets sales reps and managers track individual and team performance in real time. Performance dashboards are typically customizable and easily adapted to display the particular metrics you want to track
A dashboard is sales tech that provides a visual representation of your most recent performance metrics. It gives you a concise view of results-based data like sales-to-date, sales-by-region, lead conversion rate, sales growth, and so on.

It also lets you track activity-based metrics so you can view calls made, emails sent, and what the average lead response time is to different outreach methods.

Dashboards are an essential tool for any business with plans to increase revenue and set ambitious growth goals. Without a sales dashboard, you’re left to analyze dizzying amounts of data on your own. Trying to compile all those sales analytics metrics manually is an impossibly exhausting task with a massive risk of critical human errors.

A good sales dashboard is the solution. It organizes your most recent sales-specific data into easily understandable visual graphics—saving your teams precious time and increasing understanding, motivation, and accuracy.

Of course, there are different dashboards designed for a variety of metrics and circumstances.
